# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases scripts and small projects that I have personally engineered and deployed in multimillion-dollar infrastructure environments. Each example reflects my ability to design, automate, and support reliable solutions that are actively used in production — not just side experiments.

What’s Inside?

Automation scripts – reducing repetitive work and improving efficiency

System tools – managing logs, files, and configurations at scale

Data utilities – parsing, cleaning, and organizing information

Infrastructure helpers – supporting reliability in complex environments




Tech I Work With:

Python

Bash / Shell scripting

PowerShell

SQL

Git / GitHub




How to Use...

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tech-portfolio.git





Purpose:

The goal of this repository is to give employers and collaborators a clear view of how I approach technical challenges. These scripts are real-world solutions I’ve written, tested, and deployed — showing not only how I code, but how I deliver value in professional environments.
