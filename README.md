## ðŸ“š About Me

Young, Aspiring PenTester

From the age of 14, I've been extremely tech and network centric; building my first computer at 14 and experimenting with Wireshark, Cain and Abel, LANC, and proxy servers later that same year.

Since then, I've excelled in every environment I've landed inâ€”not just with knowledge, but also through my strong communication skills and charismatic demeanor. In high school, I was selling computers, providing tech support to friends, ranking in HTB comps, and experimenting with creating my own tools to aid my pen-testing journey. I graduated early, enrolled at WGU for a Cyber Reliability course, and was picked up a month after graduation to work at a respected law firm, where I've grown astronomically in the tech and security world.
