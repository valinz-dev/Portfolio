## ðŸ“š About Me

From the age of 14, Iâ€™ve been immersed in technology and networking. I built my first computer at 14 and spent that same year experimenting with tools like Wireshark, Cain & Abel, LANC, and proxy servers to understand network behavior at a deeper level.

Since then, Iâ€™ve thrived in every technical environment Iâ€™ve enteredâ€”not only because of my technical knowledge, but also due to my strong communication skills, curiosity, and ability to connect with people. In high school, I was building and selling PCs, providing support for friends and small businesses, competing in Hack The Box challenges, and writing small automation tools to make everyday life easier.

I graduated and enrolled at Western Governors University, pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance, and soon after HS graduation, I joined a respected law firm as an IT professional. In this role, Iâ€™ve grown rapidlyâ€”bridging traditional infrastructure with modern security practices and sharpening my skills in legal-tech environments.

Outside of work, I like to:

Develop Discord bots for personal projects and friends.

Build and tune my 446whp Ford Focus ST â€” including a full big turbo setup, custom fab work, wiring, tuning, and a custom audio system. (See progress: [focusst.org profile](https://www.focusst.org/members/vanders.139893/)

This repository showcases scripts and small projects that I have personally engineered and deployed in live environments. Each example reflects my ability to design, automate, and support reliable solutions that are actively used in production.

It includes automation scripts to reduce repetitive tasks and improve efficiency, system tools for managing logs, files, and configurations at scale, data utilities for parsing and cleaning information, and infrastructure helpers that support uptime and reliability.

TECHNOLOGIES
Python
Bash / Shell scripting
PowerShell
SQL
Git / GitHub


PURPOSE
This repository is intended to demonstrate my coding style and technical skills in a professional context. The scripts here are not just experiments â€” they are solutions I have written, tested, and deployed to support production systems and large-scale infrastructure.
