# Trial Bot

Trial Bot is a Discord bot that allows server members to be put on trial in a fair and structured way. 
The bot uses OpenAI's API to review input such as reasons or submitted evidence to generate a verdict and sentencing. 
This allows for decisions that are based on reasoning instead of random chance.

This project was created for a personal server and includes a special case for a specific Discord user (thunder.2240). 
When this user is tried, the bot skips the AI reasoning process and automatically issues the maximum sentence.

The bot also includes basic error logging for OpenAI so that issues can be identified easily if the API fails.

## Features
- AI-assisted verdicts and sentencing
- Special case handling for targeted usernames
- Error logging for OpenAI
- Clean embed messages for verdicts
- Simple command structure

## Example Commands
!hello
Greets the user and explains how to use the bot.

!trial @username reason:stole my fries
Runs a trial for the mentioned user. The bot uses OpenAI to analyze the reason and return a verdict.
