PowerShell Scripts

PowerShell automation has been the most applicable area of my real-world work, and the examples here demonstrate that. These scripts are built to automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and support production systems in environments where reliability is critical.

Each script is annotated with notes for ease of use, explaining functions clearly and concisely so that anyone reviewing the code can quickly understand the purpose and workflow.

My background lies heavily in legal software, which is reflected in several scripts for iManage automation and bug repair. These examples highlight not only my coding ability, but also my experience tailoring automation to specific industry requirements.

Please note that a large portion of my professional work cannot be disclosed. What I share here is for demonstration purposes only â€” scripts may not run copy-and-paste in another environment. They are intended as examples for employers and as references for future builds.
